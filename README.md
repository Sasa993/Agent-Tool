# Agent Tool

I've created this Software/Desktop Application while I was working in Tech-Support company.
I used **PyQT4** for GUI development and **SQLite3** as a RDBMS. The main reason why I used SQLite (and not other relational data base) is that SQLite is serverless. I also used a bit of **Numpy** and **Matplotlib** libraries for working with data (charts).

Main usage of this software is entering, saving (in certain template/order), showing and searching customer's data, description of the problems and troubleshooting steps. It also tracks your call duration which helps you to determine the longest calls and so on.

You are also able to change the time your shift ends.
